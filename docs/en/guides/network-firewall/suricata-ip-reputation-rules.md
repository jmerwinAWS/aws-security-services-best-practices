8.43. IP Reputation Keyword

IP Reputation can be used in rules through a new rule keyword "iprep".

For more information about IP Reputation see IP Reputation Config and IP Reputation Format.
8.43.1. iprep

The iprep directive matches on the IP reputation information for a host.

iprep:<side to check>,<category>,<operator>,<reputation score>

side to check: <any|src|dst|both>

category: the category short name

operator: <, <=, >, >=, =

reputation score: 0-127

Example:

alert ip $HOME_NET any -> any any (msg:"IPREP internal host talking to CnC server"; flow:to_server; iprep:dst,CnC,>,30; sid:1; rev:1;)

This rule will alert when a system in $HOME_NET acts as a client while communicating with any IP in the CnC category that has a reputation score set to greater than 30.
8.43.1.1. isset and isnotset

isset and isnotset can be used to test reputation "membership"

iprep:<side to check>,<category>,<isset|issnotset>

side to check: <any|src|dst|both>

category: the category short name

To test whether an IP is part of an iprep set at all, the isset can be used. It acts as a >=,0 statement.

drop ip $HOME_NET any -> any any (iprep:src,known-bad-hosts,isset; sid:1;)

In this example traffic to any IP with a score in known-bad-hosts would be blocked.

isnotset can be used to test if an IP is not a part of the set.

drop ip $HOME_NET any -> any any (iprep:src,trusted-hosts,isnotset; sid:1;)

In this example traffic for a host w/o a trust score would be blocked.
8.43.1.2. Compatibility with IP-only

The "iprep" keyword is compatible with "IP-only" rules. This means that a rule like:

alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"IPREP High Value CnC"; iprep:src,CnC,>,100; sid:1; rev:1;)

will only be checked once per flow-direction.
